<h1>Hey there, I'm David</h1>
<h3>A Systems Engineering Student who likes music, coding, and being creative.</h3>

<h3>My experience and work</h3>
<h7>I have knowledge of different programming paradigms and languages, as well as relational databases and their normalization. Logical and systematic thinking are key to solving any problem I encounter. Below, you will find some of my work where I faced things I didn’t know at first, but through curiosity and research, I was able to solve them. </h7>



I also have some projects that I’m proud of. They reflect what I’ve learned so far, so if you’re curious, check them out below.  

Thanks, David  </h7>
