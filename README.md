<h1>Hey there, I'm David</h1>
<h3>A Systems Engineering Student who likes maths, coding, and being creative.</h3>

<h3>My experience and work</h3>
<h7>I have knowledge of different programming paradigms and languages, as well as relational databases and their normalization. Logical and systematic thinking are key to solving any problem I encounter. Below, you will find some of my work where I faced things I didn’t know at first, but through curiosity and research, I was able to solve them. </h7>

<h3>Random facts about me and how i started with technology :D</h3>
<h7>When I was a kid, I wanted to be an astronaut. Then I grew up and wanted to be a football player. Later... I grew up some more and realized I wanted to do something with technology.  

One of my favorite movies is *Big Hero 6* (a very underrated movie, in my opinion). For me, the level of technology in that movie was fascinating and truly inspiring. Many of the choices I’ve made about my career as a student were influenced by things like movies, people, and experiences.  

I started programming in school at 13 with Pascal. I liked it and I wasn’t bad at it either. Time passed, I learned more programming languages, and I discovered new topics like networks, databases, and everything related to tech. My high school and the orientation I chose helped me a lot on that path.  

Later, I went to university and chose the Computer Science career, which I truly enjoy.  

Of course, I also have passions outside of technology: music and sports. I just love moving, competing, and giving everything on the court. Tennis, football, basketball—you name it, and I’ll give my all.   

So, to summarize… yes, I’m a complete nerd haha.   

I also have some projects that I’m proud of. They reflect what I’ve learned so far, so if you’re curious, check them out below.  

Thanks, David  </h7>
