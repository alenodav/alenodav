<h1>Hey there, I'm David</h1>
<h3>A Systems Engineering Student who likes maths, coding, and being creative.</h3>

<h3>My experience and work</h3>
<h7>I have knowledge of different programming paradigms and languages, as well as relational databases and their normalization. Logical and systematic thinking are key to solving any problem I encounter. Below, you will find some of my work where I faced things I didn’t know at first, but through curiosity and research, I was able to solve them. </h7>

<h3>Random facts about me and how i started with technology :D</h3>
<h7>When I was a kid, I wanted to be an astronaut. Then I grew up and wanted to be a football player. Later... I grew up some more and realized I wanted to do something with technology.  

One of my favorite movies is *Big Hero 6* (a very underrated movie, in my opinion). For me, the level of technology in that movie was fascinating and truly inspiring. Many of the choices I’ve made about my career as a student were influenced by things like movies, people, and experiences.  

I started programming in school at 13 with Pascal. I liked it and I wasn’t bad at it either. Time passed, I learned more programming languages, and I discovered new topics like networks, databases, and everything related to tech. My high school and the orientation I chose helped me a lot on that path.  

Later, I went to university and chose the Computer Science career, which I truly enjoy.  

Of course, I also have passions outside of technology: music and sports. I just love moving, competing, and giving everything on the court. Tennis, football, basketball—you name it, and I’ll give my all.   

So, to summarize… yes, I’m a complete nerd haha. 

<h3>Rules i live by every day</h3>
Last but not least, throughout my life I’ve talked to many people, many of them smarter than me, and I’ve learned valuable lessons that I live by every day. I want to share them with you:  

1. Do the work. That’s it. Just do it.  
2. If you truly love what you’re doing, you won’t even notice the time passing. That’s when you know your work is good.  
3. Discipline is the only thing that will take you where you want to be.  
4. Talk to people. Be curious. Staying too introspective won’t get you far.  
5. Make yourself easy to find. You have value, make it count.  
6. Improve 1% every day. That’s the real magic.  
7. Do the hard work. Anyone can do the easy stuff.  
8. Train hard and save your money.  
9. Think about compound interest—not only with money. The rest is history.
10. My favourite: be CREATIVE.

And that’s all you need to know about me… I think.  

I also have some projects and exercises that I’m proud of. They reflect what I’ve learned so far, so if you’re curious, check them out below.  

Thanks, David  </h7>
